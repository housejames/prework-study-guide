# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

I created this website to help me study the prework that I need to know in order to become a great developer at the UCI coding bootcamp. This project was built with efficiency in mind to remind myself and others the key things that helped me while learning to create my first site. The site helps understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Throughout the course of making this site I took away many things like creating ssh keys and working with github repositories.
